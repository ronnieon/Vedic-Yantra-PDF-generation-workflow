## Tips for Creating Your Story

1. **Keep scenes concise**: 2-3 sentences per scene works best
2. **Be visual**: Describe what should be seen in the image
3. **Character consistency**: Describe characters in detail so they look the same across scenes
4. **Scene variety**: Mix different locations and actions to keep the story dynamic
5. **Clear narrative arc**: Beginning, middle, and end with a resolution
6. **Express emotions**: Mention how characters feel (curious, brave, scared, wise) - these will be labeled in draft sketches
